<em>When Voice Leads to Exit: Political Competition and Education Sector Design in Developing Democracies:</em> My dissertation examines education policy in developing democracies, focusing on variation in the institutional arrangments that shape the education sector. Who provides education? Is it the state, or non-state actors? What is the content of education? I create a typology of education systems, linking this to the incentives created under democratic poiltical compettion in low-capacity democracies.
