	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the political science department at MIT, where I study comparative politics and methodology. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant with MIT GOV/LAB. My primary research interest centers on the relationship between state and non-state providers of public goods. 
		My dissertation project examines the design of education sectors, 
		seeking to understand why and how states engage with the non-state schooling sector, particularly religious schools. 
		What explains variation in the state’s willingness to recognize and fund non-state schools, 
		as opposed to directly providing education to citizens? 
		When states do delegate educational authority, how closely do they monitor and regulate the non-state schooling sector? 
		How does the expansion of the non-state schooling sector shape future bureaucratic capacity, and citizen attitudes 
		towards the government?</a></p>
	<p> I study these questions in late-developing and low-capacity states, providing insights into how citizen-state relations are forged in modern state-building, and how these patterns differ from historical processes. Regionally, I focus on South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. I have conducted fieldwork in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Uganda.</a></p>
	<p>These questions are situated within a broader research agenda that focuses on the causes and consequences of non-state actors’ participation in governance, particularly religious actors. When citizens have access to non-state institutions that perform similar functions to the formal state, how does it reshape their relationship with the formal state?

	<p>I received my BA from Tufts University in 2013. Prior to graduate school, I work as a Research Support Associate in the Political Science Department at MIT, and a field research coordinator for MIT GOV/LAB in Tanzania and Uganda.</a></p>
