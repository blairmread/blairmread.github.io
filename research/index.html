## Social Policy and Elite Decision-Making

- When Voice Leads to Exit: Political Competition and Education Sector Design in Developing Democracies (Dissertation Project): 
My dissertation examines education policy in developing democracies, 
focusing on variation in the institutional arrangments that shape the education sector. **Who** provides education? 
Is it the state, or non-state actors? What is the content of education? I create a typology of education systems, 
linking this to the incentives created under democratic poiltical compettion in low-capacity democracies.
